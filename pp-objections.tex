  \begin{block}{Pairing is Difficult}
  Pairing {\em is} a skill, but not one that is difficult to aquire\cite{Mendes:2005:IPN:1151954.1067526}. Participants in pairing tend to view the practice positively, even after initial resistance\cite{Begel:2008:PPW:1414004.1414026}.

  \begin{block}{Process Problems}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Uncertainty about how to design in a pair
  \item Need to research privately
  \item Lack of infrastructure
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Personality Issues}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Toxic pairs
  \item Pair Marriage
  \item Mismatched skill level
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Not if, but how}
  Mostly, these sorts of problems are not problems with pair programming, but with how a particular group manages and supports pair programming.
