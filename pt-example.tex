  \begin{block}{Partiphification}
    We have \emph{n} jobs to distribute over \emph{m} processes. Our goal is to write a function that partitions the jobs equally.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Jobs are input as an array
      \item We want the array split into subarrays
      \item The split should be as even as possible
      \item The function should be as generic as possible
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Invariants}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We should have \emph{m} sublists
      \item Every job should be in a sublist
      \item Every job should appear once in all sublists
      \item The length of every sublist should be +-1 of any other
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
